# Fixed-Rate Stacks Bonds

A decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity 4. This project enables users to issue and purchase fixed-term bonds that pay a fixed interest rate upon maturity.

The protocol is designed to provide predictable returns for investors and a predictable cost of capital for issuers, differentiating it from traditional variable-rate yield protocols like Stacking.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Fixed Term & Rate:** Bonds are issued with a predefined maturity date and interest rate.
* **BTC Reward Distribution:** Interest payments (rewards) are managed and distributed in STX, or linked to anticipated BTC Stacking rewards (future extension).
* **Clarity 4 Optimized:** Utilizes enhanced type checking and error handling provided by Clarity 4 for secure financial calculations.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

* Node.js (LTS version)
* Clarinet (CLI tool for Stacks development)
